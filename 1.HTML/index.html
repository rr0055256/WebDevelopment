	<p>JAWA is a motorcycle manufacturer founded in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1929 by František Janeček, who bought the motorcycle division of Wanderer. The name JAWA was established by concatenating the first letters of Janeček and Wanderer. In the past, especially in the 1950s, JAWA was one of the top motorcycle manufacturers and exported its 350 (Pérák) into over 120 countries. Another famous model in the 1970s was the 350 Californian. It appeared in the typical black and red coloring from Californian beaches to New Zealand. After 1990, there was a significant loss of production. A successor company was formed in 1997 in Týnec nad Sázavou, continuing the name as JAWA Moto</p>

The catchphrase for the bikes sold by the firm was "Forever bike forever value".Jawa motorcycles were introduced in India in 1960 and they have a cult following to this present day. Production was carried out directly in India by Ideal Jawa India Ltd based out of Mysore. The Jawa 353/04 designated as 'A' Type, Yezdi 250 'B' Type, Jawa 350 type 634 Twin and Yezdi 250 Monarch models are driven to this day in various parts of the country.

	<h3>Yezdi Roadking<a name="Yezdi Roadking" /></h3>
	<p>Yezdi Roadking is a motorcycle produced in India by Ideal Jawa Ltd, Mysore from 1978 to 1996. The bike was based on the CZ 250 ridden by rider Jaroslav Falta to the runner-up spot in the 1974 motocross world championship. It was sold under the brand name Yezdi. The bike won several Indian rallies and road races in India. The bike had a 250 cc engine with twin exhausts and a semi-automatic clutch.</p>

	<h4>History</h4>
	<p>The Yezdi Roadking was the successor of the not-too-successful Yezdi OilKing.The OilKing was the first motorcycle in India to attempt to move away from pre-mixed fuel to a separate oil lube system via an oil pump.The box like shape on the left hand cover housed the oil pump.Unfortunately this system had a very high failure rate resulting in piston seizures.This resulted in the dis-continuation of the OilKing and the birth of the Roadking.The Roadking, though, still had (has) the box on the left hand side of the engine that housed the oil pump in the OilKing. The Yezdi Roadking was originally based on 1974 CZ, where the original bore and stroke of 70 mm × 64 mm (2.76 in × 2.52 in) was retained as it was, but with less power than its Motocross original. The engine block is smaller and different from the Yezdi Classic in appearance. Also the CZ original had the famous Porcupine Head while the same was used only in initial models, later reverted to regular straight fin design. The cylinder block (Type 980.5) was from CZ.Just like in the older Ideal Jawa or the Ideal Yezdi,the Roadking too came with an original Tesla (Czechoslovakian) headlight bulb as standard.</p>
	
	<h4>Engine</h4>
	<p>The cylinder block was from CZ which had an over square bore x stroke. Carburetors were either Jikov (tickler choke) or Pacco (press type choke) of which the former was exclusively for Roadking while the latter was used for Classic models. The spark plugs were of cold type and the bike also featured a semi-automatic or auto clutch, where a cam inside the gearbox housing automatically activated the clutch through a cam which is unique to this and other Yezdi models in India. The familiar Jawa-CZ twin exhaust ports made the unmistakable sound when the exhaust flute mufflers and end-cores were removed. Another unique feature of the bike was that the kick-starter and the gear shared the same rod as with all Yezdi models. Once the gear rod is reversed it doubles as a kicker and once started it automatically returns to the original position. The lever has an internal cam which engages/disengages the clutch when the gear is shifted thereby precluding the need for a hand-clutch.</p>
